## Introduction: Chicago's Regulatory Response to Airbnb's Rapid Growth

Airbnb has reshaped urban hospitality by enabling people to rent out their private spaces. By 2016, Airbnb had woven itself into the fabric of Chicago's tourism economy, flourishing to such an extent that regulatory measures became necessary to manage its impacts on the city. In response to Airbnb's expansion, the City of Chicago introduced comprehensive regulations to maintain control and fairness in the home-sharing market[^2]. These regulations, including registration requirements, taxation, and limitations on rental units[^3], introduced both opportunities and challenges for Airbnb hosts.

### Unveiling Insights Through Data Analysis

Our analysis of over 730,000 data points reveals a surge in Airbnb listings until 2016, driven by factors such as the increasing popularity of home-sharing[^4] and the growing acceptance of the sharing economy[^6], followed by a noticeable decline post-regulation, as illustrated in the accompanying graph.

## Individual VS Corporate Hosts

Delving deeper into the data, we identified two distinct types of hosts: individual hosts, averaging about 1.4 listings each, and larger enterprises, which manage between 10 to as many as 600 listings. This discrepancy allows us to explore the contrasting operational scales and strategies employed by individual hosts and businesses in the Airbnb ecosystem.

#### Price Trend

**Impact of the 2016 Ordinance**
Our analysis reveals a clear distinction in the effects of the 2016 ordinance on individual versus corporate hosts. Listings for individual hosts decreased significantly, while corporate host listings showed more stability. Similarly, pricing trends diverged: prices for individual hosts generally remained stable or decreased, whereas prices for corporate hosts increased. These trends suggest underlying regional differences, which we will explore through detailed maps of listing distributions across Chicago.

### Regional differences

#### Regional impacts on price and new listings
The regional distribution of Airbnb listings in Chicago, as shown in the accompanying maps, further elucidates the differential impact of the 2016 regulations. Corporate hosts are predominantly concentrated in central Chicago, areas known for their high demand and tourism value. This concentration in central locations allows corporate hosts to increase their prices to offset the heightened operational costs due to new taxes and fees.

> [!NOTE] 
> Hotel occupancy rate in the central region of Chicago, specifically in the Loop area, reached 75%. While occupancy rate for the Chicago in total was around 63.1% [^3].

In contrast, individual hosts are more widely dispersed around these central areas, extending into less central regions of Chicago. This spread likely contributes to the variability in demand they experience, which in turn influences their pricing strategies. As depicted in the maps, individual hosts in these less central areas have generally seen a stabilization or decrease in their prices, reflecting the challenges of maintaining competitiveness and demand in regions with lower tourist traffic.

This geographic and economic dichotomy underlines the broader implications of regulatory measures on different types of hosts, highlighting how location significantly shapes the challenges and opportunities faced by Airbnb hosts in Chicago.


## Superhosts: Champions of Hospitality and Growth

In response to the challenges faced by individual hosts, we explored the role of the Superhost program—a beacon of excellence within the Airbnb community. Superhosts, distinguished by their exceptional hospitality and service, enjoy enhanced visibility and credibility on the platform. Research from Inside Airbnb supports this notion, indicating that Superhosts attract significantly more bookings and higher guest satisfaction rates compared to regular hosts[^5].

Our analysis further revealed a symbiotic relationship between Superhost status and individual hosts. Notably, it's evident that the allure of achieving Superhost status incentivizes individual hosts to enhance their listings and service quality. This correlation underscores the effectiveness of the Superhost program in empowering individual hosts and driving the increase in listings, thereby contributing to the overall growth and success of Airbnb.

Further analysis of Superhost status distribution between individual hosts and companies revealed intriguing trends. The data showed that the Superhost program is more prevalent among individual hosts, with a ratio of superhosts to non-superhosts being 1 to 1, compared to a ratio of 1 to 2 in company listings. This disparity suggests that individual hosts are more actively engaged in and committed to achieving Superhost status, which aligns with our earlier observations regarding the impact of Superhosts on guest satisfaction and overall success metrics.

Metrics by Superhosts show that individual superhosts indeed contribute to overall rating, price, and reviews. Our analysis indicated that listings managed by individual superhosts tend to command higher prices, receive more positive reviews, and maintain higher overall ratings compared to non-superhosts. This underscores the pivotal role played by Superhosts in elevating the quality of the Airbnb experience and fostering a culture of excellence within the hosting community.

### Harnessing the Power of Superhosts for Growth

By incentivizing individual hosts to aspire to Superhost status, Airbnb can empower them to thrive amidst regulatory constraints. Through targeted support and resources, Airbnb can cultivate a vibrant ecosystem of Superhosts, thereby enriching the overall guest experience and bolstering the platform's resilience against regulatory challenges.


## Looking Ahead: Strategies for Success in the Sharing Economy

As Chicago's Airbnb landscape continues to evolve, there are several key takeaways for Airbnb's strategic endeavors:

- **Policy Influence:** Acknowledging the significant impact of city policies on individual hosts, Airbnb must advocate for regulatory frameworks that support and nurture small-scale hosts.
  
- **Superhost Focus:** Directing resources towards the development and recognition of Superhosts among individual hosts will foster growth and resilience within the Airbnb community.
  
- **Diversification and Expansion:** By diversifying and expanding the Superhost program, Airbnb can broaden access to resources and opportunities, thereby enhancing the overall Airbnb economy.

By aligning strategic initiatives with the needs and aspirations of individual hosts, Airbnb can navigate the intricacies of the sharing economy, ensuring a vibrant and sustainable ecosystem for hosts and guests alike. As Chicago's Airbnb adventure unfolds, the journey towards innovation and growth continues, fueled by collaboration, resilience, and a shared commitment to hospitality.
