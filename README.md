## Chicago's Regulatory Response to Airbnb's Rapid Growth

Airbnb has reshaped urban hospitality by enabling people to rent out their private spaces. By 2016, Airbnb had woven itself into the fabric of Chicago's tourism economy, flourishing to such an extent that regulatory measures became necessary to manage its impacts on the city. In response to Airbnb's expansion, the City of Chicago introduced comprehensive regulations to maintain control and fairness in the home-sharing market[^2]. These regulations, including registration requirements, taxation, and limitations on rental units[^3], introduced both opportunities and challenges for Airbnb hosts.

### Unveiling Insights Through Data Analysis

Our analysis of over 730,000 data points reveals a surge in Airbnb listings until 2016, driven by factors such as the increasing popularity of home-sharing[^4] and the growing acceptance of the sharing economy[^6], followed by a noticeable decline post-regulation, as illustrated in the accompanying graph.

## Individual VS Corporate Hosts

Delving deeper into the data, we identified two distinct types of hosts: individual hosts, averaging about 1.4 listings each, and larger enterprises, which manage between 10 to as many as 600 listings. This discrepancy allows us to explore the contrasting operational scales and strategies employed by individual hosts and businesses in the Airbnb ecosystem.

#### Price Trend

**Impact of the 2016 Ordinance**
Our analysis reveals a clear distinction in the effects of the 2016 ordinance on individual versus corporate hosts. Listings for individual hosts decreased significantly, while corporate host listings showed more stability. Similarly, pricing trends diverged: prices for individual hosts generally remained stable or decreased, whereas prices for corporate hosts increased. These trends suggest underlying regional differences, which we will explore through detailed maps of listing distributions across Chicago.

### Regional differences

#### Individual VS Company Listing regions

#### Regional difference and Price difference by region
<img width="741" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-07 at 1 14 48 AM" src="https://github.com/pyjlTW/Airbnb-Blog/assets/60620023/cc2afd2e-2d15-4e5c-a05d-113f98ad88de">

#### Regional impacts on price and new listings
The regional distribution of Airbnb listings in Chicago, as shown in the accompanying maps, further elucidates the differential impact of the 2016 regulations. Corporate hosts are predominantly concentrated in central Chicago, areas known for their high demand and tourism value. This concentration in central locations allows corporate hosts to increase their prices to offset the heightened operational costs due to new taxes and fees.

> [!NOTE] 
> Hotel occupancy rate in the central region of Chicago, specifically in the Loop area, reached 75%. While occupancy rate for the Chicago in total was around 63.1% [^3].

In contrast, individual hosts are more widely dispersed around these central areas, extending into less central regions of Chicago. This spread likely contributes to the variability in demand they experience, which in turn influences their pricing strategies. As depicted in the maps, individual hosts in these less central areas have generally seen a stabilization or decrease in their prices, reflecting the challenges of maintaining competitiveness and demand in regions with lower tourist traffic.

<img width="486" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-07 at 1 26 28 AM" src="https://github.com/pyjlTW/Airbnb-Blog/assets/60620023/3a20aec6-f078-4539-8959-100108998b28">

This geographic and economic dichotomy underlines the broader implications of regulatory measures on different types of hosts. While businesses adeptly navigated the regulatory landscape, smaller individual hosts encountered substantial obstacles. The imposition of high taxes, registration requirements, and substantial fines disproportionately impacted individual hosts, resulting in a decline in new listings and lower qualities of housings as lowering cost would not help paying requirements.


## The Role of Superhosts in Mitigating Regulatory Impact

In response to the challenges faced by individual hosts, we explored the role of the Superhost program—a beacon of excellence within the Airbnb community. Superhosts, distinguished by their exceptional hospitality and service, enjoy enhanced visibility and credibility on the platform. Research from Inside Airbnb supports this notion, indicating that Superhosts attract significantly more bookings and higher guest satisfaction rates compared to regular hosts[^5]. 

<img width="800" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-07 at 1 31 22 AM" src="https://github.com/pyjlTW/Airbnb-Blog/assets/60620023/a709e498-7eb1-46a1-b2c9-8068f8f670c9">

The data above showcases the clustering of listings with a focus on Superhost distribution. Notably, in the central region of Chicago, where corporate hosts predominate and have managed to increase prices, the proportion of Superhosts is significantly different from less central areas. 

#### Super host percentage

#### Sentiment in super host
<img width="514" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-07 at 2 38 59 AM" src="https://github.com/pyjlTW/Airbnb-Blog/assets/60620023/3f82b2c7-fc68-4e21-b30d-1c23401b2438">

This divergence highlights a key insight: Superhosts among individual hosts are more prevalent in areas with higher regulatory impacts. This suggests that individual hosts may leverage the benefits of Superhost status—such as increased visibility and trust—to counterbalance the challenges posed by strict regulations. This is contrasted by corporate hosts, who might not rely as heavily on Superhost status due to their different operational scales and strategies.

#### Benefits of superhost
<img width="441" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-07 at 2 35 30 AM" src="https://github.com/pyjlTW/Airbnb-Blog/assets/60620023/a5d42804-9090-49f5-916e-ea885b8af8ce">

Metrics by Superhosts show that individual superhosts indeed contribute to overall rating, price, and reviews. Our analysis indicated that listings managed by individual superhosts tend to command higher prices, receive more positive reviews, and maintain higher overall ratings compared to non-superhosts. This underscores the pivotal role played by Superhosts in elevating the quality of the Airbnb experience and fostering a culture of excellence within the hosting community.

### Refining the Superhost Program

<img width="974" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-07 at 2 36 40 AM" src="https://github.com/pyjlTW/Airbnb-Blog/assets/60620023/5281c22c-9b01-495f-8f20-7d13d579f0fe">

With k-means clustering to host attributes and guest ratings, we identified key groups among hosts. The 2 main clusters indicate that while the current Superhost rating threshold stands at 4.8, a more nuanced approach might be beneficial. Our findings suggest that ratings of 4.9 and 4.5 serve as more effective cutoffs for differentiating levels of service quality and guest satisfaction.

Our analysis recommends a tiered Superhost system that better reflects the diverse qualities of hosting. By using data-driven methods to refine criteria like response times and cancellation rates, Airbnb can better align its recognition program with the varied performance and operational styles of hosts. These adjustments will ensure the program's criteria are more inclusive and representative of all hosts' efforts

## Strategies for Success in the Sharing Economy

As the Airbnb landscape in Chicago continues to evolve, it becomes imperative to adapt our strategies to the realities of the local market. Enhancing the Superhost program, advocating for supportive regulatory frameworks, and expanding access to resources are pivotal steps. These efforts will not only aid in the recovery and stability of small-scale hosts affected by the 2016 ordinance but also enrich the overall Airbnb ecosystem, ensuring a vibrant, equitable, and sustainable future for all stakeholders involved in Chicago’s dynamic home-sharing landscape.

By aligning strategic initiatives with the needs and aspirations of individual hosts, Airbnb can navigate the intricacies of the sharing economy, ensuring a vibrant and sustainable ecosystem for hosts and guests alike. As Chicago's Airbnb adventure unfolds, the journey towards innovation and growth continues, fueled by collaboration, resilience, and a shared commitment to hospitality.
